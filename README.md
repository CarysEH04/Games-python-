# Hangman
Small project from the first year of my degree which aimed to focus on filehandling and the use of classes and packages

## Files
- dictionary.txt - csv of words, the program reads in the file and randomly selects a word from the dictionary for the user to guess
- board.py - python file which defines several variables for the different stages of the hangman board
- selectaword.py - contains the function which randomly selects a words
- hangman.py - defines the game class which contains functions for guessing and recording the guess and for uncovering letters. Also has a separate function for running the game.
